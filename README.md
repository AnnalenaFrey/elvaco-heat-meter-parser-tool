This project is a web application developed as part of an advanced practical course. The application processes payloads from district heating systems, visualizes their data in interactive charts, and performs plausibility checks. Users can select different machine types, analyze errors, and review detailed information about the payloads.
Features:
Payload parsing and detailed data visualization.
Interactive charts with real-time plausibility checks.
Error table dynamically adjusted to the selected machine type.
Clean and responsive design for ease of use.
The application is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and uses Chart.js for data visualization.
